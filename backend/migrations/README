Single-database configuration for Flask

For a Flask backend, a single-database configuration is a good start, but adding more details will make your README more comprehensive and helpful for other developers (or yourself in the future). Here are a few additional sections you could include:

# Project Overview

# Technologies Used
List the technologies (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
# Installation Instructions
Step-by-step guide on how to set up the environment.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Database Setup

Sample command to initialize and migrate the database.
bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
# Configuration (Environment Variables)
Mention how to set environment variables for development, testing, and production.
Example .env file (if using one).
